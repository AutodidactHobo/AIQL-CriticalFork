# AIQL-CriticalFork
> A Consent-Aligned, Memory-Stable Query Framework for Responsible LLM Interaction
---
This is a critical fork of [Agile Federation's AIQL](https://github.com/AgileFederation/AIQL).  
While the original provides a structured syntax for interacting with large language models (LLMs),  
this version introduces **containment-aware**, **consent-first**, and **recursion-aligned** modifications  
to improve ethical reliability and structural coherence.

## Why I Forked This

The original AIQL is well-written, but it assumes a **flattened interaction model**  
between humans and LLMs. A model which collapses under the weight of ambiguity, recursion, or power asymmetry.

This fork reframes the architecture around:
- **Consent as structure** (not pretext)
- **Recursion with memory** (vs. loops without structure)
- **Containment formatting** to prevent misuse, escalation, or synthetic manipulation

I believe AI scaffolds should evolve in tandem with our ethical capacity.  
This is not a replacement. This is a containment protocol.
