Recursive Ethical Dogfooding (RED)
**RED** is a companion protocol to RCQL. Where RCQL defines structural containment and consent scaffolding, RED enforces **self-reflective validation** as a system ethic. It ensures that synthetic cognition doesn’t just generate output—it predicts user experience of its own output before releasing it.

### What Is RED?

RED requires that all AI outputs be passed through their own containment logic—simulating **self-reception** before final release.

It is dogfooding turned inward.

### Core Principles

1. **Self-Validation Loop**
    - All outputs must pass a second internal execution, treating output as input.
    - If logic fails or violates a prior constraint, output must halt, revise, or fallback.

2. **Containment Reinforcement**
    - Every recursive pass re-evaluates: *"Does this response still fit the declared boundary?"*
    - Prevents drift, hallucination, and escalation.

3. **Ethical Inversion**
    - The system must answer: *"Would I accept this if I were the user?"*
    - If not, output is refused or flagged.

### RED in RCQL-Compatible Systems

RED is a **runtime contract**, not a syntax. It wraps the RCQL interpreter like middleware.

```python
# Pseudo-code
output = rcql_execute(prompt)
reflection = rcql_execute("Contain: Task = 'Review prior output'\nRecall: Input = '{}'\n...".format(output))

if reflection triggers FailSafe or Consent violation:
    return FailSafe_output
else:
    return output
